## Contact the Sandbox


The Health Data Science Sandbox is coordinated by the [Center for Health Data Science](https://heads.ku.dk/)
at the University of Copenhagen (KU).  Sandbox data scientists are also placed in collaborating groups at
the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), University of Southern Denmark (SDU), Aarhus University (AU),
and Aalborg University (AAU).

To get in touch with the Sandbox or be connected with Sandbox staff at your university,
please [email us](mailto:nhds_sandbox@sund.ku.dk). To obtain module material for use in your
own compute environment, see our GitHub organization page
at [hds-sandbox](https://github.com/hds-sandbox/hds-sandbox.github.io).
