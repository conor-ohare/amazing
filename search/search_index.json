Analysis demos are provided as R Markdowns and Python Jupyter notebooks wherever possible. See our Github org at hds-sandbox for access. These resources and required computational tools are installed and managed in Sandbox environments provided by Computerome (DTU) and UCloud (SDU) where compute resources can also be requested. Usage: We are currently supporting courses in health data science, where students are granted access to the Sandbox on request by collaborating professors. We plan to open Sandbox access to a broader user base starting with university students and researchers once more modules are developed. See our contact page if you have questions. Support: We are currently providing support through a Sandbox slack channel. See our contact page for more information. Contribute: The Sandbox welcomes proposals for new courses, modules, and prototyping projects from researchers. We'd like to partner with lecturers engaged with us in developing needed materials collaboratively - we would love to have input from subject experts or help promote exciting new tools and analysis methods via modules! Please contact us with your ideas at nhds_sandbox@sund.ku.dk . Acknowledgements: We thank the Novo Nordisk Foundation for funding support via the Data Science Research Infrastructure initiative.

Thank you!","title":"Home"},{"location":"about/about/","text":"The Health Data Science Sandbox is a national project coordinated by the Center for Health Data Science at the University of Copenhagen. Advisors and project data scientists are located at five Danish universities. We are building a data science sandbox for students and researchers that contains non-person-sensitive datasets spanning key health data domains \u2013 electronic health records, omics data such as genomics and transcriptomics, images, and wearable device data. Datasets are sourced from public databases or generated via privacy-preserving approaches to synthetic health data. We are building modules that pair topical datasets with recommended analysis tools, pipelines, and learning materials/tutorials in a portable, containerized format. Our initial aim is to support university courses and programs in health data science and personal medicine, with broader environment access for researchers and university students planned in the future. Our sandbox for exploring health data science techniques will allow low-stakes guided learning and development followed by a smooth transition to a secure environment where users\u2019 knowledge and tools can be applied to sensitive data. The sandbox environment is hosted on Danish supercomputers providing compute power while modules are publicly accessible on GitHub .

Once approved as a user, you will receive your username and server address (URL) by email, and you will receive an initial course-platform password by text. On Computerome, the Sandbox environment is deployed as a virtual machine with a Linux desktop as user interface. This environment can be accessed through VMware Horizon using two different methods: (A) a desktop client (which you install on your computer) or (B) a web-based client (for those without install privileges on their computer). Please follow the appropriate instructions (A versus B) depending on your access preference. Sign-In Instructions On FIRST login, enter the provided server address (URL) in a browser window to access the environment using your provided credentials. The URL will take you to a VMware Horizon access portal where you can (A) choose to install the desktop client (left: 'Install VMware Horizon Client'). You will then open this client for all subsequent logins instead of using the server address, and can login starting from step 2. (B) access the environment via browser (right: 'VMware Horizon HTML Access'). You will always use the server address in your browswer to access this entry point if this is your chosen method of access. Select the cloud icon (A) which is linked to the server URL. This option appears when you have successfully installed and opened the VMware Horizon client. (B) which is linked to the Sandbox course. This option appears after you have selected VMware Horizon HTML Access. Enter your username and your course-platform password. On the first sign-in, this will be the course-platform password texted to you. You will then be prompted to create your own permanent password to replace this password which you will use for all future sign-ins. When prompted, enter the one-time password texted to you from DTU (NOT the same password as the course-platform password). (A) If it is your first login / you logged off at last access, press any key when greeted with the blue time status screen. This will allow you to select your own user account in a dialog box. Sign-in using your course-platform password again after choosing the correct language for the environment in the upper right corner of the screen (this is important for the keyboard and typing your password). Danish (the da option) is default, so those with English keyboards will need to switch to English (the en option) at every login. Congratulations, you have entered the Sandbox environment. Relevant links for courses should be present on your desktop. Exit Instructions To exit the environment, you have two options with different outcomes. You can log off and kill all running processes, or you can disconnect and your processes will continue running. \"Power off\" is disabled for users as this will shut down your virtual machine, local settings and user files may be lost, and the virtual machine will need to be manually restarted for your account. To exit and kill all running processes, select the power icon in the upper right corner, then select your name and choose \"log off\" in the pop up window. To exit and preserve running processes, (A) hover at the top of the screen for a few seconds until your VMware Client menu is accessible, choose \"Connection\", and select \"Disconnect\". (B) close the browser tab where you are accessing the Sandbox environment.","title":"Computerome"},{"location":"access/Computerome/#accessing-the-sandbox-on-computerome","text":"To set up a user account on Computerome, you will need to provide administrators with your name, email address, and phone number for two-factor authentication.

A major component is addressing how to analyze and leverage person-specific data, such as electronic health records, without invading personal privacy or straying from GDPR guidelines on sensitive data use. We are therefore focused on using either publicly accessible datasets (that are generally well anonymized to enable such release) or we are using/creating synthetic datasets that mimic real-world datasets without replicating real people's data such that they can be identified. In either case, it is essential for Sandbox users to treat person-specific data respectfully and be aware of the additional responsibility and limitations of working with this type of data as part of their career in health data science. We recommend that users interested in this type of data complete an ethics course on research using health datasets before digging into any analysis. A well regarded course that is also often required for using public databases that contain person-specific data is the Human Subject and Data Research Ethics course designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The course is hosted at CITI , the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative. Completing the course is free of charge and provides you with a certificate which you may need to upload to certain databases to gain access. Set up an account at CITI, add an Institutional affiliation with 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates', and then find and complete the course titled 'Data or Specimens Only Research' to obtain a certificate (in pdf form). Public domain data \u00b6 The intended scope of the Sandbox is broad, and we will be pulling from many different public access databases in our development of teaching modules.

Synthetic/Simulated data \u00b6 The Sandbox is focused on supporting Danish health data science education and research. Via our collaborators and broader network, we have the opportunity to simulate/synthesize data resembling different databases and registries from the Danish health sector in addition to using traditional data simulation techniques to replicate general datasets.
