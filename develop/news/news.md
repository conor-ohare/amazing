### 18/08/22 - Bulk RNA-seq course launched 

Today we begin teaching our brand new bulk RNA-seq course to researchers at SUND at KÃ¸benhavn Universitet. 
Our team have put a lot of time and effort into making the course up-to-date and engaging, through a 
combination of lectures and exercise sessions. We'd like to extend our thanks to HeaDS members outside 
of the Sandbox for assisting on the day. 

For those that could not enrol for this session, you can find the relevant material [here](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/bulk_RNAseq_course/).

### 04/01/22 - Basics of Personalized Medicine

The first course supported by the Sandbox is launching this month - 'Basics of Personalized Medicine' - where students in the new Master in Personal Medicine program at University of Copenhagen are introduced to predictive modeling using electronic health records.
